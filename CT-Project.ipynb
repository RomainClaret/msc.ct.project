    "#### Side note for github readers: This notebook has been made to optimize the delivery of the project into a Graasp page. So please don't yell at me when you see wierd stuff e.g. multiple importation of the same library. Addictionally, I will probably continue this project when I will have some free time as i am interested to go further into the covid analysis and this tool could be a nice starting point."

    "## Meta\n",
    "- Author: Romain Claret\n",
    "- University: Neuchatel, Switzerland\n",
    "- Class: Computational Thinking\n",
    "- Type: Project\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem\n",
    "As of early 2021, information about covid became usual. Indeed, datasets and graphic visualisation became commun to find, but often doesn't explicitly show what we are looking for.\n",
    "Here was are aiming at building a tool to extract information from multiple datasets with the goal of finding and showing explicitly what we are looking for, e.g., trying to find the correlations between the new Covid cases and the Vaccination campaign in Switzerland, based on the official datasets provided by the Swiss Government.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution\n",
    "Our approach is to provide a class for the Regions (canton) of Switzerland, containing all the information related to Covid based on a specific date. Region objects self-updates when the date is modified, all information for a specific date can be displayed as a graph or a table, and exported as a dataframe or a list.\n",

    "## Abstraction\n",
    "As I am no expert in the medical field, I will try to gather as much information (that I think important initially) to build a dataset containing the following (preferably by day, by canton):\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- number of tests done for the date and in total until this date\n",
    "- number of positive tests for the date and in total until this date\n",
    "- number of hospitalizations for the date and in total until this date\n",
    "- number of deaths for the date and in total until this date\n",
    "- number of vaccinations done for the date and in total until this date\n",
    "- number of vaccinations completed (seconde dose) for the date and in total until this date\n",
    "- percentage of vaccination for the date and in total until this date\n",
    "- reproductive number Re for the date and in total until this date\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I will be focusing on maintained (up to date) datasets:\n",
    "- Will focus on auto-maintained datasets (which use scheduled scrapers)\n",
    "- Will not fill holes but replace the missing information by 0\n",
    "\n",
    "## Patterns\n",
    "- dataset loading\n",
    "- data extraction\n",
    "- use of a graph template to display data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Decomposition\n",
    "- use of pandas' dataframes for the data manipulations\n",
    "- gather the official raw datasets from sources\n",
    "    - focusing on csv files ready to use (summaries)\n",
    "    - make a scraper for csv files unready to use as it is\n",
    "    - build a custom dataset for our project\n",
    "    - standardize the cantons columns names\n",
    "    - take into concideration of unmatching name for Switzerland (CH <-> CHE) \n",
    "- calculate additional data\n",
    "    - use the datetime object to substract days and load information previous day information\n",
    "- display values in tables\n",
    "- use of different charts (and maps to highlight key information)\n",
    "    - plots\n",
    "    - (Switzerland map ->not implemented: geoposition libraries like geopandas, shapefile are not present in graasp)"

    "- It came to conclusion that it would not be necessary to build a scraper, as multiple public projects are already gathering and building datasets.\n",
    "- After some research, we could find all the features required, but no dataset was aggregating all the required features at once.\n",
    "- It was then undertaken to build a custom dataset by merging the minimum amount of datasets to cumulate our required features.\n",
